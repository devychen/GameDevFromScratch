# Game Development: Learning from Scratch

> A record of my self-learning road to become a GAMEDEV and also a LLM Prompt Engineer. I might switch to other related specialists tho, haven't make it final yet. But these knowledge should still be helpful.

#### My background:
1. Education:
   - MA Computational Linguistics (Tuebingen, DE)
   - MSc Sociology (Oxford, UK)
   - BA Sociology (Manchester, UK)
2. Professions:
   - Game Marketer (ByteDance)
   - Management Consultant (A.T.Kearney)
   - TV Producer (MGTV)

## Programming Language (in hierarchy)
1. **Java**: Part of the degree courses
2. **C++**: Everyone looks so confused when heard I chose C++ for self-learning. But my reason is very simple: UE.
3. **Python**: Only use it for NLP data analysis.

#### Books and other materials I use for these languages
1. **Java**
   - 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Structure and Algorithms 1&2
   - 📖 and its textbook: _Java: An Introduction to Problem Solving And Programming (6th)_, Walter Savitch
   - 📖 _On Java (8th)_
   - Tutorials:
      - [Runoob Java](https://www.runoob.com/java/java-basic-syntax.html) (in CN)
      - [Java Full Stack Knowledge](https://pdai.tech/md/outline/x-outline.html) (in CN)
      - [All classes by Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/allclasses-noframe.html)
      - [Oracle tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
      - w3school
   - Sources:
      - [Java API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/index.html) 
2. **C++**
   - 📖 I started with _C++ Primer Plus_ (6th)
   - Tutorials:
      - [Runoob C++](https://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-tutorial.html)
3. **Python**
   - 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Science for Linguists
   - 📖 and its textbook: _Python Data Science Handbook_, O'Reilly
   - 📖 _Python for Data Analysis_, O'Reilly (Of course, old friend O'Reilly)
   - [w3schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), I use it as a Pythonwiki
   - [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.12/contents.html)

## Mathematics
1. Linear Algebra
   - 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/gerhardJaeger/linear_algebra_wise23)
   - The very famous [MIT Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/) course, and two useful notes: [Note 1](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes), [Note 2](https://github.com/guokaide/linear-algebra) (in CN)
2. Calculus
3. Statistics
   - 🧑‍🏫 Degree courses: Statistical Methods for NLP 1&2 

## Data Science 
Low priority, not a focus. Only for necessarity.
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Science for Linguists
- Interesting materials:
   - [An intro tutorial to SpaCy](https://course.spacy.io/en/chapter1)

## Machine Learning & Deep Learning
##### Frameworks, Algorithms

## NLP Frameworks

## LLM (Transformers)
Degree course: Transformer-based Language Models (I did not take it yet due to a lack of necessary knowledge, but worth to read the materials)

## Prompt Engineering

## Unreal Engine

## Computer Graphics
Online Course: [UCSB](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html)
