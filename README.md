# Game Development Learning from Scratch

## Programming Language (in hierarchy)
1. Java: Part of the degree courses
2. C++: Everyone looks so confused when heard I chose C++ for self-learning. But my reason is very simple: UE.
3. Python: Only use it for NLP data analysis.

### Books and other materials I use for these languages
1. java
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Structure and Algorithms 1&2
- 📖 and its textbook: Java: An Introduction to Problem Solving And Programming (6th), Walter Savitch
- 📖 On Java (8th)
- (Sometimes for faster learning): [Runoob Java](https://www.runoob.com/java/java-basic-syntax.html) (in CN)
- (Haven't use it yet) [Java Full Stack Knowledge](https://pdai.tech/md/outline/x-outline.html) (in CN)
2. C++
- 📖 I started with C++ Primer Plus (6th)
- (Sometimes for faster learning): [Runoob C++](https://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-tutorial.html)
3. Python
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Science for Linguists
- 📖 and its textbook: Python Data Science Handbook, O'Reilly
- 📖 Python for Data Analysis, O'Reilly (Of course, old friend O'Reilly)
- [w3schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), I use it as a Pythonwiki
