# Game Development Learning from Scratch

> A record of my self-learning road to become a GAMEDEV and also a LLM Prompt Engineer. I might switch to other related specialists tho, haven't make it final yet. But these knowledge should still be helpful.

#### My background:
1. Education: MA Computational Linguistics (Tuebingen 🇩🇪), MSc Sociology (Oxford 🇬🇧), BA Sociology (Manchester 🇬🇧)
2. Professions: Game Marketer (ByteDance), Management Consultant (A.T.Kearney), TV Producer (MGTV)

## Programming Language (in hierarchy)
1. Java: Part of the degree courses
2. C++: Everyone looks so confused when heard I chose C++ for self-learning. But my reason is very simple: UE.
3. Python: Only use it for NLP data analysis.

### Books and other materials I use for these languages
1. java
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Structure and Algorithms 1&2
- 📖 and its textbook: Java: An Introduction to Problem Solving And Programming (6th), Walter Savitch
- 📖 On Java (8th)
- (Sometimes for faster learning): [Runoob Java](https://www.runoob.com/java/java-basic-syntax.html) (in CN)
- (Haven't use it yet) [Java Full Stack Knowledge](https://pdai.tech/md/outline/x-outline.html) (in CN)
2. C++
- 📖 I started with C++ Primer Plus (6th)
- (Sometimes for faster learning): [Runoob C++](https://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-tutorial.html)
3. Python
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Science for Linguists
- 📖 and its textbook: Python Data Science Handbook, O'Reilly
- 📖 Python for Data Analysis, O'Reilly (Of course, old friend O'Reilly)
- [w3schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), I use it as a Pythonwiki

## Mathematics
1. Linear Algebra
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/gerhardJaeger/linear_algebra_wise23)
- The very famous MIT Linear Algebra course, and two useful notes: [Note 1](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes), [Note 2](https://github.com/guokaide/linear-algebra) (in CN)
2. Calculus
3. Statistics
- Degree courses: Statistical Methods for NLP 1&2
