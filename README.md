# Game Development: Learning from Scratch

> A documentation of my self-learning journey to become a GAMEDEV and also an LLM Prompt Engineer. I might switch to other related specialties, though; I haven't finalized my decision yet. Nevertheless, this knowledge should still be beneficial

#### My background:
1. Education:
   - MA Computational Linguistics (Tuebingen, DE)
   - MSc Sociology (Oxford, UK)
   - BA Sociology (Manchester, UK)
2. Professions:
   - Game Marketer (ByteDance)
   - Management Consultant (A.T.Kearney)
   - TV Producer (MGTV)

## Programming Language (in hierarchy)
1. **Java**: Part of the degree courses
2. **C++**: Everyone looks so confused when heard I chose C++ for self-learning. But my reason is very simple: UE.
3. **Python**: Only use it for NLP data analysis.

#### Books and other materials I use for these languages
