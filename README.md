# Game Development Learning from Scratch

> A record of my self-learning road to become a GAMEDEV and also a LLM Prompt Engineer. I might switch to other related specialists tho, haven't make it final yet. But these knowledge should still be helpful.

#### My background:
1. Education:
   MA Computational Linguistics (Tuebingen 🇩🇪), MSc Sociology (Oxford 🇬🇧), BA Sociology (Manchester 🇬🇧)
3. Professions:
   Game Marketer (ByteDance), Management Consultant (A.T.Kearney), TV Producer (MGTV)

## Programming Language (in hierarchy)
1. Java: Part of the degree courses
2. C++: Everyone looks so confused when heard I chose C++ for self-learning. But my reason is very simple: UE.
3. Python: Only use it for NLP data analysis.

### Books and other materials I use for these languages
1. Java
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Structure and Algorithms 1&2
- 📖 and its textbook: Java: An Introduction to Problem Solving And Programming (6th), Walter Savitch
- 📖 On Java (8th)
- (Sometimes for faster learning): [Runoob Java](https://www.runoob.com/java/java-basic-syntax.html) (in CN)
- (Haven't use it yet) [Java Full Stack Knowledge](https://pdai.tech/md/outline/x-outline.html) (in CN)
2. C++
- 📖 I started with C++ Primer Plus (6th)
- (Sometimes for faster learning): [Runoob C++](https://www.runoob.com/cplusplus/cpp-tutorial.html)
3. Python
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: Data Science for Linguists
- 📖 and its textbook: Python Data Science Handbook, O'Reilly
- 📖 Python for Data Analysis, O'Reilly (Of course, old friend O'Reilly)
- [w3schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp), I use it as a Pythonwiki

## Mathematics
1. Linear Algebra
- 🧑‍🏫 Degree course: [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/gerhardJaeger/linear_algebra_wise23)
- The very famous [MIT Linear Algebra](http://ocw.mit.edu/) course, and three useful notes: [Note 1](https://github.com/MLNLP-World/MIT-Linear-Algebra-Notes), [Note 2](https://github.com/guokaide/linear-algebra), [Note 3](https://file.notion.so/f/f/b6ee8281-3297-4dd8-817d-6d934fad59c7/84584dc2-b814-4f8b-8146-ff92059d1485/%E8%B6%85%E8%AF%A6%E7%BB%86MIT%E7%BA%BF%E6%80%A7%E4%BB%A3%E6%95%B0%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%80%E8%AF%BE%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0.pdf?id=692fd558-e50d-4e05-a1bd-931eaad28acc&table=block&spaceId=b6ee8281-3297-4dd8-817d-6d934fad59c7&expirationTimestamp=1702080000000&signature=1tddEYBfk1BhRpjyFto_7Qx7bG8g8ik9XxbYJudHMHI&downloadName=%E8%B6%85%E8%AF%A6%E7%BB%86MIT%E7%BA%BF%E6%80%A7%E4%BB%A3%E6%95%B0%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%80%E8%AF%BE%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0.pdf) (in CN)
